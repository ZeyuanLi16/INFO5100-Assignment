For this homework assignment, you will be writing code in support of a Dessert Shoppe which sells candy by the pound, cookies by the dozen, ice cream, and sundaes (ice cream with a topping). Your software will be used for the checkout system.
To do this, you will implement an inheritance hierarchy of classes derived from a DessertItem abstract superclass.
The Candy, Cookie, and IceCream classes will be derived from the DessertItem class.
The Sundae class will be derived from the IceCream class.
You will also write a Checkout class which maintains a list (Vector) of DessertItem's.
The DessertItem Class
The DessertItem class is an abstract superclass from which specific types of DessertItems can be derived. It contains only one data member, a name. It also defines a number of methods. All of the DessertItem class methods except the getCost() method are defined in a generic way in the file Class-DessertItem, provided for you along with the other homework specific files in the directory. The getCost() method is an abstract method that is not defined in the DessertItem class because the method of determining the costs varies based on the type of item. Tax amounts should be rounded to the nearest cent. For example, the calculating the tax on a food item with a cost of 199 cents with a tax rate of 2.0% should be 4 cents. The complete specifications for the DessertItem class are provided in the file Class-DessertItem.
The DessertShoppe Class
The DessertShoppe class  contains constants such as the tax rate as well the name of the store, the maximum size of an item name and the width used to display the costs of the items on the receipt. Your code should use these constants wherever necessary! The DessertShoppe class also contains the cents2dollarsAndCentsmethod which takes an integer number of cents and returns it as a String formatted in dollars and cents. For example, 105 cents would be returned as "1.05".

The Derived Classes
All of the classes which are derived from the DessertItem class must define a constructor. The TestCheckout class determine the parameters for the various constructors. Each derived class should be implemented by creating a file with the correct name, eg., Candy.java.
The Candy class should be derived from the DessertItem class. A Candy item has a weight and a price per pound which are used to determine its cost. For example, 2.30 lbs.of fudge @ .89 /lb. = 205 cents. The cost should be rounded to the nearest cent.
The Cookie class should be derived from the DessertItem class. A Cookie item has a number and a price per dozen which are used to determine its cost. For example, 4 cookies @ 399 cents /dz. = 133 cents. The cost should be rounded to the nearest cent.
The IceCream class should be derived from the DessertItem class. An IceCream item simply has a cost.
The Sundae class should be derived from the IceCream class. The cost of a Sundae is the cost of the IceCream plus the cost of the topping.
The Checkout Class
The Checkout class, provides methods to enter dessert items into the cash register, clear the cash register, get the number of items, get the total cost of the items (before tax), get the total tax for the items, and get a String representing a receipt for the dessert items. The Checkout class must use a Vector to store the DessertItem's. The total tax should be rounded to the nearest cent. The complete specifications for the Checkout class are provided in the file Class-Checkout.
Testing
A simple testdriver, TestCheckout.java along with its expected output, are provided for you to test your class implementations. You can add additional tests to the driver to more thoroughly test your code.
